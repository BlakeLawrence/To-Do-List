## What did I learn

- Cemented the onChange event (used to update text state)
- This exercise (as it was alot earleir on in my learning) helped me understand and cement the concept of props and prop drilling.
- Mapping and filtering methods for adding and deleting to do items immutably
- Using the text state as the input tags value in order to clear the input field after each submission (after the addToDo function fires, setText ("") to clear input field)
