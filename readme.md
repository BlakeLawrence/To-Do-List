# To Do List

A simple to do list App built with React

There is no back-end for this app and so any data you input will not be persistent and will be lost upon leaving the site or refreshing the page.

This app is one of my first projects and is here to display my understanding of basic React concepts.

## What did I learn

- Cemented the onChange event (used to update text state)
- This exercise (as it was alot earleir on in my learning) helped me understand and cement the concept of props and prop drilling.
- Mapping and filtering methods for adding and deleting to do items immutably
- Using the text state as the input tags value in order to clear the input field aftere ach submission (after the addToDo function fires, setText ("") to clear input field)
