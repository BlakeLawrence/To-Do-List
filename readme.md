# To Do List

A simple to do list App built with React

Please note: There is no back-end or database for this app. Any data you input will not be remembered and will be reset upon leaving the site or refreshing the page.

This app is one of my first projects and is here to display my understanding of basic React concepts.

## Instructions

- type a to do item in the input field
- click the "add to do" button to add this item to the list
- If you have completed a to do item, click the green tick ‚úÖ next to the item to cross it off the list
- if you want to delete a specific item, click the red cross ‚ùå next to the item to delete the item

## What did I learn

- Cemented the onChange event (used to update text state)
- This exercise (as it was alot earleir on in my learning) helped me understand and cement the concept of props and prop drilling.
- Mapping and filtering methods for adding and deleting to do items immutably
- Using the text state as the input tags value in order to clear the input field after each submission (after the addToDo function fires, setText ("") to clear input field)
